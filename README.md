# Sorting-algorithm-visualizer
A small python program that visualizes every step of sorting process. 
Number of elements can be adjusting using the slider.
Sorting algorithm and order can be adjusting by clicking on the buttons, though I haven't implemented a way for user to see which options are currently selected (Selection sort and ascending order by default)
During the sorting user cannot interact with the window except clicking the "Quit" button
After the elements are sorted, user can interact with the rest of window again.
